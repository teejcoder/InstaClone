## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Firebase

Replicating the Popular Social Media App INSTAGRAM using ReactJS. Built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and connected to Firebase backend to improve functionality.

## Optimizations

For full functionality InstaClone need to be able to delete posts and have a night mode. A few cosmetic upgrades with better display fonts, and menu icons.

## Lessons Learned:

I had that 'Woah, this is awesome' moment when I saw the first post upload in real time. I learnt that there is no end to improvements and I had to settle at a point.
